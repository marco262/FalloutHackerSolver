# Fallout Hacking Solver

Hacking in Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 is a fun though sometimes frustrating word puzzle game. I find I have more fun coding up tools to solve puzzles than solving them myself.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7.X (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- wxPython 2.9.X (http://www.wxpython.org/)

## Setup
1. Run fallout_pw.py

## Usage
This program works best when running Fallout in Windowed mode, or on a separate PC.

1. Type all the words seen in the terminal into the text field on the bottom left, hitting Enter or clicking 'Add' after each one. (See screenshot.png)
2. If you made a mistake, you can select a single word and click 'Delete Word'.
3. Once you've type in all the words, look for the word listed under "The best word to try is:" on the right. This is the word you should click in Fallout.
4. Select how many letters matched from your attempt, and click the Go button.
5. Continue from step 3 until you've hacked the terminal!
